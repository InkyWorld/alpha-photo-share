    """
    Endpoint to check the health of the database connection.

    This endpoint performs a simple database query (`SELECT 1`) to verify if the database
    is connected and configured correctly. If the query succeeds, a success message with
    the result is returned. If the query fails or any other error occurs during the connection,
    an HTTP 500 error is raised with a message indicating the failure.

    Args:
        db (AsyncSession): The database session, injected by FastAPI's dependency system.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the database query fails or the database connection is not properly
        configured, an HTTP 500 error is raised with an appropriate message.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing a health check message and the result of the query.

    Example:
        ```python
        response = await client.get("/api/health_checker")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {"message": "Database is connected and healthy", "result": 1}
        ```

            raise HTTPException(
